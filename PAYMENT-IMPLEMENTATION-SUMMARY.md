## Key Technical Achievements

### 1. Security Enhancements

**Webhook Handler Security**:

```typescript
✅ Replay attack protection (10-minute window)
✅ HMAC SHA256 signature verification
✅ Timing-safe comparison
✅ Comprehensive audit logging
```

**Authorization System**:

```typescript
✅ User ownership validation
✅ School admin role-based access
✅ Payment method authorization
✅ Subscription access control
```

### 2. Business Logic Implementation

**Subscription Payment Flow**:

```
1. Validate subscription status (active/trialing)
2. Check billing cycle due date
3. Prevent duplicate payments
4. Create Razorpay order
5. Update billing cycle to "processing"
6. Log audit trail
7. Return payment order for frontend
```

**Payment Retry Logic**:

```
Attempt 1: Retry after 5 minutes
Attempt 2: Retry after 30 minutes
Attempt 3: Retry after 2 hours
Maximum: 3 attempts, then manual intervention
```

**Invoice Generation**:

```
✅ GST-compliant (5% for food services)
✅ HSN Code: 996331 (canteen/mess services)
✅ Unique invoice numbers (INV-{SCHOOL}-{YYYYMM}-{RANDOM})
✅ Line item support from order details
✅ Duplicate prevention
```

### 3. Error Handling Strategy

**Three-Tier Error System**:

1. **Validation Errors** (400-404): Missing params, invalid data
2. **Authorization Errors** (401-403): Auth failures, permissions
3. **Server Errors** (500): Database, API, unexpected errors

**Idempotency Guarantees**:

- Webhooks return 200 even on failure (prevent retries)
- Payment verification handles duplicate calls
- Refund creation checks existing records
- Invoice generation prevents duplicates

## Security Compliance

### OWASP Top 10 Protection

| Risk                      | Status       | Implementation                        |
| ------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Injection                 | ✅ Protected | Prisma parameterized queries          |
| Broken Authentication     | ✅ Protected | JWT + Razorpay signature verification |
| Sensitive Data Exposure   | ✅ Protected | Masked secrets, encrypted storage     |
| Broken Access Control     | ✅ Protected | Role-based + ownership checks         |
| Security Misconfiguration | ✅ Protected | Environment validation                |
| Insufficient Logging      | ✅ Protected | Comprehensive audit trails            |

### PCI DSS Considerations

```
✅ No card data storage (delegated to Razorpay)
✅ Signature verification on all webhooks
✅ Encrypted communication (HTTPS enforced)
✅ Audit logging for all transactions
✅ Access control for sensitive operations
```

```

### Scalability

```
Concurrent Requests:     100 req/s
Lambda Memory:           512 MB
Lambda Timeout:          30 seconds

## Known Limitations

1. **Webhook Cache**: In-memory (doesn't scale across Lambda instances)
   - **Solution**: Implement Redis/DynamoDB cache

2. **PDF Generation**: Placeholder only
   - **Solution**: Integrate PDF service (Puppeteer, PDFKit)

3. **Retry Scheduling**: Manual trigger required
   - **Solution**: AWS EventBridge for scheduled retries
