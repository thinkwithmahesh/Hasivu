- **Performance**: Core Web Vitals monitoring, caching strategies

### Backend (Node.js/Express)

- **Runtime**: Node.js 18 with TypeScript
- **Architecture**: RESTful API with Express.js
- **Security**: JWT authentication, rate limiting, input sanitization
- **Monitoring**: Health checks, performance metrics
- **Integration**: Python services via child process

### Infrastructure

- **Containerization**: Docker with multi-stage builds
- **Orchestration**: Docker Compose with health checks
- **Load Balancer**: Nginx with SSL termination
- **Caching**: Redis for session storage

## Operational Procedures

### Deployment Process

```bash
# Standard deployment
./deployment/deploy.sh production

# Rollback to previous version
./deployment/deploy.sh rollback [version]

# Cleanup old resources
./deployment/deploy.sh cleanup
```

### Monitoring Access
