## Animation & Micro-interactions

### Motion Principles

**Purposeful Motion:** Every animation serves a functional purpose - providing feedback, guiding attention, or maintaining context during transitions. No decorative animations that impact performance or accessibility.

**Duration Standards:** 
- Micro-interactions: 150-300ms for immediate feedback
- Screen transitions: 300-500ms for spatial context
- Loading states: Continuous with progress indication
- Status changes: 200ms with clear before/after states

**Easing Functions:**
- Ease-out: Default for most interactions (natural deceleration)
- Ease-in-out: Screen transitions and large movements
- Linear: Progress indicators and technical status updates
- Custom: RFID scanning pulse (smooth continuous loop)

### Key Animations

- **RFID Scanning Pulse:** Continuous 2-second pulse animation with blue accent (Duration: 2000ms, Easing: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.6, 1))
- **Order Status Transition:** Smooth progression with check mark animation (Duration: 400ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Meal Card Flip:** Reveal nutritional information with 3D transform (Duration: 300ms, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Loading Skeleton:** Content placeholder with shimmer effect (Duration: 1500ms, Easing: linear)
- **Success Confirmation:** Check mark draw animation with scale bounce (Duration: 600ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Error Shake:** Subtle horizontal shake for failed actions (Duration: 300ms, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Pull-to-Refresh:** Elastic bounce with progress indication (Duration: variable, Easing: ease-out)
- **Navigation Transition:** Slide transitions maintaining spatial context (Duration: 250ms, Easing: ease-out)

## Performance Considerations

### Performance Goals
- **Page Load:** <2 seconds initial load, <1 second subsequent navigation
- **Interaction Response:** <100ms for immediate feedback, <300ms for complex operations
- **Animation FPS:** Consistent 60fps for all animations with graceful degradation on older devices

### Design Strategies

**Image Optimization:**
- WebP format with JPEG fallbacks for meal photography
- Progressive loading with blur-up technique for large images
- Responsive image sizes with srcset optimization
- Lazy loading for off-screen content with intersection observer

**Component Performance:**
- Virtual scrolling for large lists (order history, menu catalogs)
- Memoization of expensive calculations (nutritional summaries, pricing)
- Code splitting by user role and feature usage patterns
- Optimistic UI updates with rollback capabilities for network failures

**Network Optimization:**
- Offline-first architecture with intelligent caching strategies
- Background sync for non-critical data updates
- Compression and minification of all assets
- CDN distribution for static assets with regional optimization
