# Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Setup - Addition to Epic 1.1

## Enhanced Story 1.1: Project Setup and Infrastructure Foundation

**ADDITION TO EXISTING ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:**

### Infrastructure as Code Setup (Added Requirements)

13. **AWS CDK Infrastructure Setup:**
    - AWS CDK project initialized with TypeScript for infrastructure definitions
    - Separate CDK stacks for different environments (development, staging, production)
    - Infrastructure components defined as code: VPC, security groups, RDS, ElastiCache, S3, Lambda
    - CDK deployment scripts integrated with CI/CD pipeline for automated infrastructure updates

14. **Environment Management:**
    - Infrastructure configuration parameters externalized for environment-specific deployment
    - Secrets management integration with AWS Secrets Manager for sensitive configuration
    - Resource tagging strategy for cost tracking and environment identification
    - Infrastructure drift detection and correction procedures

15. **Disaster Recovery and Backup:**
    - RDS automated backup configuration with point-in-time recovery
    - S3 cross-region replication for critical assets and backups
    - ElastiCache backup and restore procedures
    - Infrastructure state backup and recovery procedures

16. **Monitoring and Observability Infrastructure:**
    - CloudWatch log groups and retention policies defined in code
    - Application performance monitoring infrastructure (DataDog agents)
    - Custom CloudWatch dashboards and alarms for infrastructure health
    - Cost monitoring and budget alerts configuration

## New Story 1.7: Infrastructure as Code Implementation

As a **DevOps engineer**,
I want **complete infrastructure defined and managed as code**,
so that **all environments can be consistently provisioned, updated, and managed through version control**.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **CDK Stack Architecture:**
   - NetworkStack: VPC, subnets, security groups, NAT gateways
   - DatabaseStack: RDS PostgreSQL, ElastiCache Redis with proper networking
   - ComputeStack: Lambda functions, API Gateway, load balancers
   - StorageStack: S3 buckets with proper policies and lifecycle management
   - MonitoringStack: CloudWatch resources, alarms, dashboards

2. **Environment Configuration:**
   - Development environment: Single AZ, smaller instance sizes, cost-optimized
   - Staging environment: Production-like setup with reduced capacity
   - Production environment: Multi-AZ, high availability, performance-optimized
   - Environment-specific parameter management through AWS Systems Manager

3. **Security Infrastructure:**
   - IAM roles and policies following principle of least privilege
   - Security groups with minimal necessary access rules
   - VPC security configuration with private subnets for databases
   - AWS Secrets Manager integration for all sensitive configuration

4. **Deployment Automation:**
   - CDK deployment pipeline integrated with GitHub Actions
   - Infrastructure change approval process for production deployments
   - Rollback procedures for infrastructure changes
   - Blue-green deployment capability for zero-downtime updates

5. **Cost Management:**
   - Resource tagging for cost allocation and tracking
   - Auto-scaling configuration for cost optimization
   - Reserved instance recommendations and management
   - Budget alerts and spending limits configuration

6. **Backup and Recovery:**
   - Automated RDS snapshots with retention policies
   - S3 versioning and lifecycle policies for data retention
   - Cross-region backup configuration for disaster recovery
   - Infrastructure disaster recovery runbooks and procedures

### Benefits

**Consistency:** All environments provisioned identically reducing configuration drift
**Version Control:** Infrastructure changes tracked and reviewable through Git
**Automation:** Deployments and updates automated reducing manual errors
**Scalability:** Infrastructure can be easily scaled up/down based on demand
**Cost Control:** Resource allocation optimized for each environment's needs
**Disaster Recovery:** Complete infrastructure recreation possible from code

### Dependencies

- **Requires:** Basic AWS account setup and permissions
- **Enables:** Reliable deployment pipeline for all subsequent development
- **Integrates:** With monitoring, security, and application deployment procedures
