## Story Breakdown

### Story 2.1: RFID Database Schema & Card Management
**Priority**: Blocker
**Estimate**: 1 week

**As a school administrator**,
**I want comprehensive RFID card management for all students**,
**so that I can efficiently distribute, track, and manage cards across the school**.

#### Implementation Tasks
```typescript
// Database Schema Extensions Needed
interface RfidCard {
  id: string;
  cardNumber: string; // Unique RFID identifier
  studentId: string;  // Link to student record
  schoolId: string;   // School association
  status: 'active' | 'inactive' | 'lost' | 'damaged';
  issuedAt: Date;
  issuedBy: string;   // Administrator who issued
  lastActivity?: Date;
}

interface RfidActivity {
  id: string;
  cardNumber: string;
  orderId: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  location: string;   // School delivery point
  verified: boolean;
  metadata?: any;
}
```

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Prisma schema updated with RFID tables
- [ ] createRfidCard Lambda fully implements card issuance
- [ ] Bulk card import for student enrollment
- [ ] Card status management (active/inactive/lost)
- [ ] Integration with existing user management system
- [ ] Audit logging for card lifecycle events

### Story 2.2: Hardware Integration Layer
**Priority**: High  
**Estimate**: 1.5 weeks

**As a system architect**,
**I want robust RFID hardware integration**,
**so that the platform communicates reliably with RFID readers**.

#### Implementation Strategy
```typescript
// Hardware Abstraction Layer
interface RfidReaderInterface {
  connect(): Promise<boolean>;
  scan(): Promise<RfidScanResult>;
  getStatus(): ReaderStatus;
  disconnect(): void;
}

// Multi-vendor support
class ZebraRfidReader implements RfidReaderInterface { }
class ImpinjRfidReader implements RfidReaderInterface { }
class HoneywellRfidReader implements RfidReaderInterface { }
```

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Hardware abstraction layer supporting 3+ vendors
- [ ] RFID reader configuration management
- [ ] Real-time status monitoring for readers
- [ ] Error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Connection pooling for multiple readers
- [ ] Security protocols for RFID data transmission

### Story 2.3: Real-time Delivery Verification
**Priority**: Critical
**Estimate**: 1.5 weeks

**As a parent**,
**I want immediate confirmation when my child receives their meal**,
**so that I have real-time visibility into meal delivery**.

#### Implementation Focus
```typescript
// Enhanced verifyRfidCard Lambda
interface DeliveryVerification {
  orderId: string;
  cardNumber: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  location: string;
  deliveryPhoto?: string; // S3 URL
  status: 'delivered' | 'failed' | 'pending';
}
```

#### Integration Points
- [ ] verifyRfidCard Lambda enhancement
- [ ] Real-time notifications (existing WhatsApp webhook)
- [ ] Photo capture capability
- [ ] Order status updates
- [ ] Failed delivery retry logic
- [ ] Offline scan synchronization

### Story 2.4: Parent Mobile Integration
**Priority**: High
**Estimate**: 1 week

**As a parent**,
**I want complete order lifecycle tracking**,
**so that I can monitor my child's meal from order to delivery**.

#### Mobile App Features
- [ ] Real-time order status updates
- [ ] Push notifications for delivery confirmation
- [ ] Delivery photo viewing
- [ ] Order history with RFID verification
- [ ] Child meal tracking dashboard
- [ ] Emergency notification overrides

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Database & Backend (Week 1)
```bash
# Prisma Schema Updates
npm run db:migrate:dev
npm run db:generate

# Lambda Function Enhancement
- Implement createRfidCard business logic
- Add comprehensive validation
- Integrate with user management
```

### Phase 2: Hardware Integration (Week 2-2.5)
```bash
# Hardware Abstraction Layer
- Multi-vendor RFID reader support
- Connection management
- Status monitoring
- Error handling protocols
```

### Phase 3: Verification System (Week 3-3.5)
```bash
# Real-time Verification
- Enhanced verifyRfidCard Lambda
- Notification integration
- Photo capture system
- Order status pipeline
```

### Phase 4: Mobile & Testing (Week 4)
```bash
# Frontend Integration
- Mobile app updates
- Real-time status displays
- Notification handling
- Comprehensive testing
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Hardware Compatibility**: Multi-vendor testing environment
- **Network Latency**: Offline-first verification with sync
- **Scale Handling**: Connection pooling and rate limiting
- **Data Consistency**: Transaction management for verification

### Business Risks
- **Hardware Costs**: Partner with schools for RFID infrastructure
- **Adoption Resistance**: Training and change management
- **Performance Issues**: Comprehensive load testing

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (>85% Coverage)
- RFID card management functions
- Hardware abstraction layer
- Verification business logic
- Notification dispatching

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end verification flow
- Multi-reader coordination
- Database transaction integrity
- External notification services

### Hardware Testing
- Multi-vendor reader compatibility
- Network failure scenarios

- Battery and power management

## Deployment Strategy

### Serverless Considerations
```yaml
Lambda Optimizations:
  - Connection pooling for RFID readers
  - Cold start mitigation for critical functions
  - Memory optimization for real-time processing
  - Dead letter queues for failed verifications

Infrastructure:
  - VPC endpoints for reader communication
  - S3 for delivery photo storage
  - CloudWatch for real-time monitoring
  - DynamoDB streams for real-time updates
```

## Success Criteria

### Technical Metrics
- [ ] <2 second verification response time
- [ ] 95%+ RFID scan success rate
- [ ] 99.9% system uptime during school hours
- [ ] <100ms API response time for verification

### Business Metrics
