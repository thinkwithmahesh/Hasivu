# Evidence-Based Task Management & Quality Gates Framework

## Overview

This framework establishes evidence-based task management practices to prevent status inflation and ensure reliable project delivery. All task status changes must be backed by verifiable evidence and measurable outcomes.

## Core Principles

1. **Evidence-First**: All task completions must be backed by verifiable evidence
2. **Measurable Outcomes**: Progress tracked through quantifiable metrics
3. **Validation Gates**: Multi-stage validation before status progression
4. **Honest Reporting**: Accurate status reporting based on actual deliverable state

## Quality Gate Definitions

### Stage 1: Todo → Doing

**Entry Criteria:**

- [ ] Task requirements clearly defined
- [ ] Research completed (if applicable)
- [ ] Approach/strategy documented
- [ ] Dependencies identified and resolved
- [ ] Success criteria established

**Evidence Required:**

- Task description with clear acceptance criteria
- Research findings documented (for complex tasks)
- Approach strategy outlined

### Stage 2: Doing → Review

**Entry Criteria:**

- [ ] Implementation completed
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Evidence of functionality documented
- [ ] Tests passing (if applicable)
- [ ] No blocking issues remain

**Evidence Required:**

- **For Code Tasks**: TypeScript compilation success, test results
- **For Build Tasks**: Successful build artifacts, error reduction metrics
- **For Documentation Tasks**: Complete documentation artifacts
- **For Infrastructure Tasks**: Deployment validation, service health checks

### Stage 3: Review → Done

**Entry Criteria:**

- [ ] Peer review completed (if applicable)
- [ ] Quality validation passed
- [ ] Integration testing successful
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No regression issues detected

**Evidence Required:**

- Validation results (compilation, tests, deployment)
- Before/after metrics demonstrating improvement
- Integration test results
- Review sign-off documentation

## Task-Specific Quality Gates

### Development Tasks

**Evidence Requirements:**

```bash
# TypeScript Compilation
npx tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck 2>&1 | grep "error" | wc -l
# Should return 0 for successful compilation

# Test Execution
npm test [specific-test-file]
# Should show passing tests with coverage metrics

# Build Validation
npm run build
# Should complete without errors
```

### Infrastructure Tasks

**Evidence Requirements:**

- Service health endpoint responses (200 OK)
- Performance benchmarks (response times, throughput)
- Monitoring dashboard screenshots
- Log entries showing successful deployment

### Documentation Tasks

**Evidence Requirements:**

- Complete documentation files in specified locations
- Documentation review checklist completed
- Links and references validated
- Examples tested and working

## Validation Checklists

### Pre-Completion Checklist

Before marking any task as "Review" or "Done":

   - [ ] Performance within acceptable limits

2. **Quality Standards**
   - [ ] Code follows project conventions
   - [ ] Security best practices applied
   - [ ] Documentation updated
   - [ ] Tests written and passing

3. **Evidence Collection**
   - [ ] Before/after metrics documented
   - [ ] Screenshots/artifacts captured
   - [ ] Validation results recorded
   - [ ] Integration impact assessed

### Task Status Validation Matrix

| Task Type               | Todo→Doing            | Doing→Review            | Review→Done           |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Build/Compilation**   | Requirements clear    | Zero compilation errors | Integration validated |
| **Feature Development** | Design approved       | Tests passing           | User acceptance       |
| **Bug Fix**             | Root cause identified | Issue resolved          | No regression         |
| **Documentation**       | Outline complete      | Content written         | Review approved       |
| **Infrastructure**      | Architecture defined  | Services deployed       | Monitoring active     |

## Evidence Templates

### Code Completion Evidence

````markdown
## Task: [Task Title]

**Completion Date:** [Date]
**Evidence Type:** Code Implementation

### Before State:

- Compilation Errors: [Count]
- Test Status: [Passing/Failing]
- Functionality: [Description]

### After State:

- Compilation Errors: 0
- Test Status: All passing ([X]/[Y] tests)
- Functionality: [Working as specified]

### Validation Commands:

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck 2>&1 | grep "error" | wc -l
npm test [test-file]
npm run build
```
````

### Artifacts:

- [File paths of changed files]
- [Test results screenshot/log]
- [Build output confirmation]

````

### Infrastructure Deployment Evidence
```markdown

**Completion Date:** [Date]
**Evidence Type:** Infrastructure Deployment

### Deployment Validation:
- Service Status: ✅ Running
- Health Check: ✅ 200 OK
- Response Time: [X]ms (< [threshold]ms)
- Error Rate: [X]% (< 1%)

- Dashboard URL: [URL]
- Alert Configuration: ✅ Active
- Log Aggregation: ✅ Working

### Performance Metrics:
- Throughput: [X] req/sec
- Latency P95: [X]ms
- Memory Usage: [X]MB

## Automated Quality Gates

### CI/CD Integration

```yaml
quality_gates:
  pre_merge:
    - typescript_compilation: required
    - unit_tests: required
    - integration_tests: required
    - security_scan: required
    - performance_check: required

  deployment:
    - health_check: required
    - smoke_tests: required
    - rollback_ready: required
```

### Validation Scripts

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# quality-gate-validator.sh

echo "Running Quality Gate Validation..."

# TypeScript Compilation Check
echo "Checking TypeScript compilation..."
if ! npx tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck; then
    echo "❌ TypeScript compilation failed"
    exit 1
fi
echo "✅ TypeScript compilation passed"

# Test Execution Check
echo "Running tests..."
if ! npm test; then
    echo "❌ Tests failed"
    exit 1
fi
echo "✅ Tests passed"

# Build Validation
echo "Validating build..."
if ! npm run build; then
    echo "❌ Build failed"
    exit 1
fi
echo "✅ Build successful"

echo "🎉 All quality gates passed!"
```

- **Quality Gate Pass Rate**: % of tasks passing all validation stages (Target: 95%+)
- **Deployment Success Rate**: % of deployments without rollbacks (Target: 98%+)

### Qualitative Metrics

- Team confidence in task status accuracy
- Reduced time spent on status clarification
- Improved project planning reliability
- Enhanced stakeholder trust

## Governance & Accountability

### Roles & Responsibilities

- **Task Owner**: Provides evidence for task completion
- **Quality Reviewer**: Validates evidence against criteria
- **Project Manager**: Monitors quality gate compliance
- **Delivery Auditor**: Conducts periodic evidence audits

### Escalation Process

1. **Level 1**: Task Owner addresses quality gate failures
2. **Level 2**: Quality Reviewer conducts additional validation
3. **Level 3**: Project Manager reviews systemic issues
4. **Level 4**: Delivery Auditor conducts comprehensive audit

## Conclusion

This Evidence-Based Task Management & Quality Gates Framework ensures project delivery reliability through systematic validation and honest reporting. By requiring verifiable evidence for all task completions, we eliminate status inflation and build stakeholder confidence in project outcomes.
