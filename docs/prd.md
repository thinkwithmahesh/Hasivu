## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Deliver a comprehensive RFID-integrated e-commerce platform that eliminates 40% operational inefficiency in school food services
- Enable seamless meal ordering, real-time delivery verification, and automated payment processing for 500+ premium schools in Bangalore
- Achieve 80% order completion efficiency within 6 months and improve parent satisfaction from 3.2/5 to 4.5/5
- Establish scalable foundation for national expansion with ₹9.0 crore annual revenue target by Year 3
- Create first-mover advantage in institutional food service technology with unique RFID verification capabilities
- Reduce parent meal coordination time by 70% (from 45 minutes to <15 minutes daily)
- Provide schools with operational cost savings of 60% through automated workflow management

### Background Context

Premium private schools in Bangalore face systematic inefficiencies in food service operations, with manual coordination systems causing ₹25 lakhs+ annual losses per institution and significant parent frustration. Current solutions are fragmented point solutions that lack institutional-specific design and real-time verification capabilities.

HASIVU addresses this market gap with the first comprehensive RFID-integrated platform specifically designed for school environments, serving a ₹415 crore serviceable market with validated demand (89% purchase intent from 150+ parent surveys). The platform leverages proven technology stack and vendor partnerships to deliver immediate operational improvements while establishing foundation for broader digital transformation in educational institutions.
