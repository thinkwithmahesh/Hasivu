# Testing Infrastructure Enhancement for Epic 1.1

## Enhanced Story 1.1: Project Setup and Infrastructure Foundation

**ADDITION TO EXISTING ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:**

### Testing Infrastructure Setup (Added Requirements)

9. **Testing Framework Configuration:**
   - Jest configured for backend API testing with TypeScript support
   - React Native Testing Library setup for mobile app component testing
   - Supertest integration for API endpoint testing
   - Playwright configured for end-to-end testing across web portals

10. **Test Environment Setup:**
   - Separate test database with automated schema setup and teardown
   - Test data seeding scripts for consistent test scenarios
   - Mock service configurations for external API testing
   - Test environment isolation preventing interference with development data

11. **Testing Pipeline Integration:**
   - Pre-commit hooks running unit tests and linting
   - CI/CD pipeline with test stages before deployment
   - Code coverage reporting with minimum 80% threshold
   - Automated test execution on pull request creation

12. **Test Organization Structure:**
   - Test file structure mirroring source code organization
   - Shared test utilities and mock data management
   - Integration test setup for service-to-service communication
   - Performance testing foundation with load testing capabilities

### Updated Epic 1 Success Criteria

**BEFORE:** Basic project setup with health checks
**AFTER:** Complete development foundation including testing infrastructure ready for TDD/BDD development

### Quality Gates
- All testing frameworks must be operational before Epic 2 development begins
- Sample tests must pass in CI/CD pipeline before accepting Epic 1 completion
- Test coverage reporting must be integrated and showing baseline measurements

## New Story 1.6: Comprehensive Testing Strategy Implementation

As a **quality assurance lead**,
I want **comprehensive testing infrastructure and strategy implemented**,
so that **all subsequent development can follow test-driven development practices with confidence**.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Unit Testing Foundation:**
   - Jest configuration with TypeScript, coverage reporting, and watch mode
   - Test utilities for database mocking and API response mocking
   - Component testing setup for React Native with rendering and interaction testing
   - Service layer testing with dependency injection and mock management

2. **Integration Testing Setup:**
   - Database integration testing with test database lifecycle management
   - API integration testing with real HTTP requests and response validation
   - Service-to-service integration testing with controlled external dependencies
   - Authentication and authorization testing across different user roles

3. **End-to-End Testing Framework:**
   - Playwright configuration for web portal testing across multiple browsers
   - Mobile app E2E testing setup using Detox for React Native
   - Critical user journey testing scenarios (registration, ordering, payment, RFID verification)
   - Cross-platform testing ensuring consistency between mobile and web experiences

4. **Performance Testing Foundation:**
   - Load testing setup using Artillery or similar tools for API endpoints
   - Mobile app performance testing with React Native performance monitoring
   - Database performance testing with query optimization validation
   - RFID integration performance testing with response time validation

5. **Test Data Management:**
   - Automated test data generation for consistent testing scenarios
   - Test database seeding and cleanup procedures
   - Mock external service responses for reliable testing
   - Production data anonymization for realistic testing scenarios

6. **Quality Assurance Integration:**
   - Automated accessibility testing integration with axe-core
   - Security testing integration with dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Code quality testing with ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript strict mode
   - Documentation testing ensuring API documentation matches implementation

### Dependencies
- **Requires:** Epic 1.1 completion (basic infrastructure)
- **Blocks:** All subsequent epic development
- **Parallel:** Can work alongside Epic 1.5 (External Service Setup)
