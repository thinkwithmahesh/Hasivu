- **[handoff-procedures.md](handoff-procedures.md)** - Team handoff procedures and responsibilities

### Development Workflows

- **Epic Planning Process** - Epic breakdown and story creation procedures
- **Sprint Management** - Sprint planning, execution, and retrospective workflows
- **Code Review Standards** - Code review guidelines and quality gates
- **Testing Procedures** - Testing strategy and validation requirements

### Documentation Maintenance

- **Update Procedures** - Document maintenance and versioning guidelines
- **Cross-Reference Management** - Managing document relationships and dependencies
- **Review Cycles** - Document review schedules and ownership

## Process Integration

### Agile Workflow Integration

The PRD sharding structure supports agile development workflows:

1. **Epic Planning**: Epic documents provide comprehensive feature specifications
2. **Sprint Planning**: Story breakdowns enable accurate sprint planning
3. **Development**: Technical assumptions guide implementation decisions
4. **Testing**: Requirements provide clear acceptance criteria
5. **Review**: Quality checklists ensure completeness

### Team Coordination

- **Product Managers**: Own epic definitions and business requirements
- **Tech Leads**: Own technical assumptions and architecture decisions
- **Developers**: Reference story details and technical specifications
- **QA Team**: Use requirements and acceptance criteria for testing
- **UX Designers**: Follow UI design goals and user experience requirements

## Next Steps and Handoff Procedures

### UX Expert Handoff

**Context**: HASIVU Platform PRD has been sharded into focused documents for improved team collaboration.

**UX Design Architecture Tasks**:

1. **Review Foundation Documents**: Start with [UI Design Goals](../03-ui-design-goals.md) for comprehensive design requirements
2. **Mobile-First Parent Experience**: Focus on Epic 3 (Parent Ordering Experience) for core user workflows
3. **RFID Verification Workflows**: Design Epic 4 interfaces for delivery verification and tracking
4. **Institutional Admin Interfaces**: Create Epic 2 and Epic 6 admin dashboards for school management
5. **Accessibility Implementation**: Ensure WCAG AA compliance across all interfaces

**Key Design Priorities**:

- Meal scheduling calendar interface with drag-and-drop functionality
- Real-time order tracking with RFID verification confirmation
- Accessibility requirements for parents with disabilities
- Mobile-first design optimized for time-constrained parents

**Design System Requirements**:

- Cross-platform consistency (React Native mobile + React web)
- School branding integration while maintaining HASIVU identity
- Performance optimization for 3G networks and older devices

### Technical Architect Handoff

**Context**: Technical architecture must support microservices-within-monorepo structure with specific integration requirements.

**Technical Architecture Tasks**:

1. **Review Technical Foundation**: Start with [Technical Assumptions](../04-technical-assumptions.md) for complete architecture overview
2. **RFID Integration Architecture**: Design hardware abstraction layer for multiple RFID vendors (Epic 4)
3. **Payment Gateway Compliance**: Architect PCI DSS compliant payment processing (Epic 5)
4. **Scalable AWS Infrastructure**: Design auto-scaling infrastructure for 100K+ concurrent users
5. **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Design school isolation and customization system (Epic 7)

**Key Technical Priorities**:

- Microservices within monorepo structure
- RFID hardware integration with 2-second response time requirement
- Payment gateway integration with PCI DSS Level 1 compliance
- 99.9% uptime during school hours (6 AM - 6 PM IST)
- Horizontal scalability on AWS with auto-scaling groups

**Architecture Constraints**:

- PostgreSQL primary database with Redis caching
- React Native for mobile with TypeScript
- RESTful APIs with OpenAPI specification
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform

### Development Team Handoff

**Context**: Epic-based development approach with clear dependencies and story breakdown.

**Development Workflow**:

1. **Foundation First**: Epic 1 must be completed before other epics can begin
2. **Parallel Development**: Epics 2-3 can run in parallel after Epic 1
3. **Integration Points**: Epic 4 (RFID) and Epic 5 (Payment) integrate with Epic 3
4. **Scaling Phase**: Epic 7 requires completion of all previous epics

**Story Implementation**:

- Each epic contains detailed stories with acceptance criteria
- Technical implementation details provided in epic documents
- Cross-references to existing story files in `/docs/stories/`
- Clear definition of done for each story

## Quality Assurance

### Document Quality Standards

- **Completeness**: All sections filled with relevant information
- **Accuracy**: Information consistent across related documents
- **Currency**: Regular updates to reflect current state
- **Accessibility**: Documents easy to navigate and understand

### Review Procedures

- **Epic Reviews**: Before sprint planning and at epic completion
- **Requirements Reviews**: During sprint planning and requirements changes
- **Technical Reviews**: During architecture decisions and major changes
- **Process Reviews**: Quarterly team retrospectives and process improvements

## Change Management

### Document Versioning

Each document maintains its own version history and change log for traceability.

### Cross-Document Impact Analysis

When updating documents, consider impacts on:

1. **Dependent Documents**: Documents that reference the updated content
2. **Team Workflows**: Process changes affecting team procedures
3. **Implementation Decisions**: Technical decisions affecting development
4. **Stakeholder Communication**: Changes requiring stakeholder notification

### Update Coordination

- **Foundation Changes**: Notify all teams and update dependent documents
- **Epic Changes**: Update epic documents and notify affected teams
- **Process Changes**: Update workflow documents and communicate to stakeholders
