- [ ] Admin interface functional for user management

### Story 1.4: API Gateway and Service Foundation

**As a system architect**,  
**I want centralized API gateway with comprehensive request management**,  
**so that all client applications can communicate securely and efficiently with backend services**.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. **API Gateway**: Request routing, authentication middleware, and rate limiting
2. **Response Format**: Standardized format with consistent error handling
3. **Request Logging**: Correlation IDs for distributed tracing
4. **API Versioning**: Backward compatibility support strategy

- [ ] Swagger documentation automatically generated
- [ ] Performance metrics collected and monitored

## Technical Implementation Details

### Infrastructure Components
```yaml
AWS Services:
  - VPC with public/private subnets
  - EC2 instances with auto-scaling groups
  - RDS PostgreSQL with Multi-AZ
  - ElastiCache Redis cluster
  - Application Load Balancer
  - CloudWatch monitoring
  - S3 for static assets and backups
```

### Database Schema Foundation
```sql
-- Core user management tables
Users (id, email, password_hash, role, school_id, status, created_at, updated_at)
Schools (id, name, code, configuration, created_at, updated_at)
UserProfiles (user_id, first_name, last_name, phone, preferences, created_at, updated_at)
ParentChildRelations (parent_id, child_id, relationship_type, created_at)
AuditLogs (id, user_id, action, entity_type, entity_id, changes, timestamp)
```

### API Response Format
```typescript
interface APIResponse<T> {
  success: boolean;
  data?: T;
  error?: {
    code: string;
    message: string;
    details?: any;
  };
  meta?: {
    pagination?: PaginationMeta;
    timestamp: string;
    requestId: string;
  };
}
```

### Security Configuration
- **JWT Secret**: Rotated every 90 days with backward compatibility
- **Rate Limiting**: 100 requests/minute per user, 1000/minute per IP
- **Password Policy**: Minimum 8 characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols
- **Session Timeout**: 24 hours with sliding window, refresh tokens 30 days
