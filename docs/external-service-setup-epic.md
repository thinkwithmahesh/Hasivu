## Dependencies and Sequencing
- **Blocks:** Epic 4 (Payment Processing), Epic 5 (RFID Integration), Epic 6 (Notifications)
- **Parallel Work:** Can be executed alongside Epic 2 (Menu Management) development
- **Completion Criteria:** All external service health checks passing before dependent epic implementation begins
