**Features**:

- Validates subscription and billing cycle
- Checks billing due dates
- Handles trial periods
- Creates Razorpay orders with subscription metadata
- Updates billing cycle status

### 7. Security Compliance

#### OWASP Top 10 Compliance

| Vulnerability            | Mitigation                        | Status                 |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Injection                | Parameterized queries (Prisma)    | ✅ Protected           |
| Broken Auth              | JWT + signature verification      | ✅ Protected           |
| Sensitive Data           | Masked secrets, encrypted storage | ✅ Protected           |
| XXE                      | JSON-only parsing                 | ✅ Not Applicable      |
| Broken Access            | Role-based + owner checks         | ✅ Protected           |
| Security Misconfig       | Environment validation            | ✅ Protected           |
| XSS                      | API-only, no HTML rendering       | ✅ Not Applicable      |
| Insecure Deserialization | Safe JSON.parse with validation   | ✅ Protected           |
| Known Vulnerabilities    | Regular dependency updates        | ⚠️ Requires monitoring |
| Insufficient Logging     | Comprehensive audit logs          | ✅ Protected           |

#### Payment Card Industry (PCI) DSS Considerations

- ✅ No card data storage (delegated to Razorpay)
- ✅ Signature verification on all webhooks
- ✅ Encrypted communication (HTTPS enforced)
- ✅ Audit logging for all transactions
- ✅ Access control for sensitive operations

### 8. Performance Optimizations

#### Database Optimization

```typescript
- Proper indexes on payment tables
- Efficient updateMany operations
- Transaction batching where possible
- Connection pooling via Prisma
```

#### Caching Strategy

```typescript
// Webhook replay protection cache
- In-memory Map for O(1) lookup
- Automatic expiry cleanup
- 10-minute retention window
```

#### API Response Times (Estimated)

```
create-payment-order: ~200ms
verify-payment: ~300ms
webhook-handler: ~400ms (includes DB updates)
process-refund: ~500ms
get-payment-status: ~100ms
```

### 9. Error Handling Strategy

#### Three-Tier Error Handling

```typescript
1. Validation Errors (400-404)
   - Missing parameters
   - Invalid data formats
   - Resource not found

2. Authorization Errors (401-403)
   - Missing authentication
   - Invalid signatures
   - Insufficient permissions

3. Server Errors (500)
   - Database failures
   - Razorpay API errors
   - Unexpected exceptions
```

#### Idempotency Guarantee

- Webhooks return 200 even on failure (prevents retries)
- Payment verification handles duplicate calls
- Refund creation checks for existing records
- Invoice generation prevents duplicates

### 10. Monitoring & Observability

#### Logging Strategy

```typescript
// Log Levels Used
- INFO: Successful operations, event tracking
- WARN: Invalid signatures, missing data
- ERROR: Database failures, API errors

// Logged Information
- Request IDs for tracing
- User IDs for audit
- Payment amounts (for reconciliation)
- Timestamps (for performance tracking)
- Error contexts (for debugging)
```

#### Audit Trail

All payment operations create audit logs with:

- Entity type and ID
- Action performed
- User who performed action
- Timestamp
- Change details (JSON)
- Metadata for additional context

## Integration Points

### 1. Razorpay Dashboard Setup Required

```bash
# Environment Variables Needed
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_xxxxx
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=xxxxx
RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=xxxxx

# Webhook URL Configuration
https://api.hasivu.com/payments/webhook
```

### 2. API Gateway Routes

```yaml
/payments/orders (POST) → create-payment-order
/payments/verify (POST) → verify-payment
/payments/webhook (POST) → webhook-handler
/payments/refund (POST) → process-refund
/payments/status/{id} (GET) → get-payment-status
/payments/retry/{id} (POST) → retry-payment
/payments/subscription (POST) → subscription-payment
/payments/invoice/{id} (POST) → invoice-generation
/payments/analytics (GET) → payment-analytics
/payments/methods (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE) → manage-payment-methods
```

### 3. Frontend Integration Example

```typescript
// Step 1: Create payment order
const { paymentOrder, razorpayKey } = await createPaymentOrder({
  orderId: 'order_123',
  amount: 500, // INR 500
});

// Step 2: Initialize Razorpay checkout
const options = {
  key: razorpayKey,
  amount: paymentOrder.amount,
  currency: paymentOrder.currency,
  order_id: paymentOrder.razorpayOrderId,
  handler: function (response) {
    // Step 3: Verify payment
    verifyPayment({
      razorpayOrderId: response.razorpay_order_id,
      razorpayPaymentId: response.razorpay_payment_id,
      razorpaySignature: response.razorpay_signature,
    });
  },
};

const rzp = new Razorpay(options);
rzp.open();
```

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations

1. **In-memory webhook cache**: Will not work across multiple Lambda instances
   - **Solution**: Use Redis/DynamoDB for distributed cache

2. **PDF generation placeholder**: Invoices don't generate actual PDFs yet
   - **Solution**: Integrate with PDF generation service (e.g., Puppeteer, PDFKit)

3. **Manual retry scheduling**: Retry delays are not automatically scheduled
   - **Solution**: Integrate with AWS EventBridge for scheduled retries

### Future Enhancements

1. **Payment reconciliation dashboard**: Daily/weekly/monthly reconciliation reports
2. **Fraud detection**: ML-based fraud detection on payment patterns
3. **Split payments**: Support for partial payments and installments
4. **Multi-currency**: Support for international payments
5. **Subscription management**: Self-service subscription upgrades/downgrades
6. **Automated invoice emailing**: Send invoices via email automatically
7. **Payment link generation**: Generate shareable payment links
8. **QR code payments**: UPI QR code generation for in-person payments
