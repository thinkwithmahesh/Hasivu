# Enhanced Monitoring Strategy for HASIVU Platform

## Purpose
Establish comprehensive monitoring and alerting system ensuring 99.9% uptime, optimal performance, and proactive issue resolution for the HASIVU school food service platform.

## Monitoring Architecture

### **Three-Tier Monitoring Approach**

#### **Tier 1: Infrastructure Monitoring**
**Scope:** AWS resources, database performance, network connectivity, RFID hardware health

**Tools:** AWS CloudWatch, DataDog Infrastructure, Custom health checks

**Metrics:**
- **AWS Lambda:** Invocation count, duration, error rate, concurrent executions
- **RDS PostgreSQL:** Connection count, CPU utilization, disk I/O, query performance
- **ElastiCache Redis:** Hit ratio, memory usage, network I/O, eviction count
- **API Gateway:** Request count, latency, 4xx/5xx error rates, cache hit ratio
- **S3:** Request metrics, data transfer, error rates, storage utilization

#### **Tier 2: Application Monitoring**
**Scope:** Business logic, user workflows, API performance, RFID integration accuracy

**Tools:** DataDog APM, Sentry, Custom business metrics

**Metrics:**
- **Order Processing:** Order completion rate, average processing time, failed orders
- **RFID Integration:** Scan accuracy rate, response time, hardware failure rate
- **Payment Processing:** Transaction success rate, payment gateway response time
- **User Experience:** App crash rate, API response time, page load time
- **Authentication:** Login success rate, token refresh rate, failed auth attempts

#### **Tier 3: Business Monitoring**
**Scope:** KPIs, user behavior, operational efficiency, financial performance

**Tools:** Custom dashboards, Business intelligence integration, Analytics platform

**Metrics:**
- **User Engagement:** Daily active users, order frequency, feature adoption
- **Operational Efficiency:** Order fulfillment time, parent satisfaction score
- **Financial Performance:** Revenue per transaction, payment processing costs
- **School Operations:** Menu publish rate, admin engagement, vendor performance
- **RFID Performance:** Delivery verification accuracy, false positive rate

## Alerting Strategy

### **Alert Severity Levels**

#### **CRITICAL (P1) - Immediate Response Required**
**Response Time:** <15 minutes, 24/7 on-call

**Conditions:**
- Platform availability <99% over 5-minute window
- RFID system failure affecting >10% of active orders
- Payment processing failure rate >5% over 10 minutes
- Database connection failures or high error rates
- Security breach or unauthorized access detected

**Actions:**
- Immediate SMS + phone call to on-call engineer
- Slack alert to all team members
- Automated escalation to management after 30 minutes
- Customer communication plan activation

#### **HIGH (P2) - Urgent Response Required**
**Response Time:** <1 hour during business hours

**Conditions:**
- API response time >3 seconds for >5 minutes
- Error rate >2% on critical user journeys
- RFID accuracy rate <95% over 30-minute window
- Mobile app crash rate >1% over 1 hour
- Database performance degradation affecting user experience

**Actions:**
- Slack alert to development team
- Email notification to product team
- Investigation required within 1 hour
- Status page update if user-impacting

#### **MEDIUM (P3) - Scheduled Response**
**Response Time:** <4 hours during business hours

**Conditions:**
- Non-critical feature failure (reporting, analytics)
- Performance degradation not affecting core workflows
- Elevated error rates on administrative functions
- Monitoring system issues not affecting platform
- Third-party service degradation with fallback available

**Actions:**
- Slack notification to relevant team
- Tracked in ticketing system
- Investigation scheduled for next business day
- Monitor for escalation to higher priority

#### **LOW (P4) - Information Only**
**Response Time:** Next planned work cycle

**Conditions:**
- Warning thresholds exceeded but no user impact
- Resource utilization trends requiring future planning
- Non-critical integration issues
- Performance metrics outside normal range but within acceptable limits

**Actions:**
- Email digest notification
- Logged for trend analysis
- Considered in sprint planning
- Documentation updated as needed
