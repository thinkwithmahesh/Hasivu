### Critical Coding Standards

**API Response Consistency** [Source: architecture.md#coding-standards]:
- All API routes MUST use standardized error handler for consistent response format
- Never return raw errors to clients - use error classification and sanitization
- Include correlation IDs in all responses for distributed tracing
- Implement proper HTTP status codes according to REST conventions

**Middleware Pattern**:
- Every protected route MUST use authentication middleware consistently
- Input validation MUST be applied before business logic execution
- Request logging MUST include correlation ID, user context, and timing information
- Error handling MUST preserve stack traces in logs while sanitizing client responses

**Performance Requirements**:
- API Gateway response time target: <200ms for all endpoints
- Rate limiting enforcement without degrading user experience
- Connection pooling for database and external service calls
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff for transient failures
