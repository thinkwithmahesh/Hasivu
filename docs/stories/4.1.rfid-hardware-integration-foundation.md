## QA Results

### Review Date: September 3, 2025

### Reviewed By: Gemini Auditor

### 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED - ARCHITECTURAL MISMATCH & INCOMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION**

**Status Inconsistency**: The story is marked as "Done". This is **incorrect**.

### Implementation Gaps Analysis

#### ❌ **Architecture Misalignment** (CRITICAL):

- **Expected**: Serverless Lambda functions, as detailed in the user story.
- **Actual**: The implementation in `src/routes/rfid.routes.ts` uses an Express.js router.
- **Impact**: This is a fundamental deviation from the documented architecture.

#### ❌ **Grossly Incomplete Implementation**:

- The user story describes a comprehensive RFID system with a hardware abstraction layer, device management, real-time communication, and security features.
- The actual implementation consists of a single, incomplete endpoint for card registration (`POST /rfid/cards`).
- Hardcoded values are used (e.g., `schoolId`, `cardType`), making the endpoint unusable in a real-world scenario.

### Final Status

**❌ NOT STARTED - REQUIRES COMPLETE RE-IMPLEMENTATION**

### Recommendations

#### **Immediate Actions**:

1.  **Architectural Decision**: The development team must decide whether to proceed with the Express.js implementation or to migrate to the serverless architecture as documented.
2.  **Full Implementation**: The RFID functionality needs to be implemented from scratch, following the detailed requirements in this user story.
3.  **Update Documentation**: The "Done" status must be removed.
