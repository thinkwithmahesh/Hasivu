## QA Results

### Review Date: September 3, 2025

### Reviewed By: Gemini Auditor

### 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED - ARCHITECTURAL MISMATCH & PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION**

**Status Inconsistency**: The story is marked as "Done". This is **incorrect**.

### Implementation Gaps Analysis

#### ❌ **Architecture Misalignment** (CRITICAL):

- **Expected**: Serverless Lambda functions, as detailed in the user story.
- **Actual**: The implementation in `src/routes/payment.routes.ts` uses an Express.js router.
- **Impact**: This is a fundamental deviation from the documented architecture.

#### ⚠️ **Partial Implementation**:

- The implementation includes some of the required features, such as Razorpay integration for creating orders, verifying payments, and creating refunds.
- However, it is missing other key features required by the user story, including:
  - Stripe integration for international payments.
  - A comprehensive payment analytics suite.
  - Multi-currency support.

### Final Status

**❌ INCOMPLETE - REQUIRES ARCHITECTURAL REFACTORING AND FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION**

### Recommendations

#### **Immediate Actions**:

1.  **Architectural Decision**: The development team must decide whether to proceed with the Express.js implementation or to migrate to the serverless architecture as documented.
2.  **Complete Feature Implementation**: The missing features from the user story, such as Stripe integration and full analytics, need to be implemented.
3.  **Update Documentation**: The "Done" status must be removed.
