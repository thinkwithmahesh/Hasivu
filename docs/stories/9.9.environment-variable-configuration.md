# Story: Implement Environment Variable Configuration for QA Fixes

## Status
InProgress

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to implement proper environment variable configuration for all secrets that were previously hardcoded,
**so that** the application can securely access all required configuration values without exposing sensitive data in the codebase.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All 180 environment variables identified in the .env.secrets file are properly configured
2. Application successfully loads and uses all environment variables
3. No hardcoded secrets remain in the codebase
4. AWS Secrets Manager integration is implemented for production deployments
5. Local development environment configuration is documented
6. Environment variable validation is implemented to ensure required variables are present
7. All tests pass with the new environment variable configuration

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Environment Variable Implementation
  - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Review .env.secrets file and categorize environment variables by service/component
  - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Create environment variable validation service
  - [ ] Subtask 1.3: Implement environment variable loading in application startup
  - [ ] Subtask 1.4: Replace all process.env.VARIABLE_NAME references with proper validation
  - [ ] Subtask 1.5: Test application with new environment variable configuration

- [ ] Task 2: AWS Secrets Manager Integration
  - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Implement AWS Secrets Manager client
  - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Create secret retrieval service for production environments
  - [ ] Subtask 2.3: Implement fallback to environment variables for local development
  - [ ] Subtask 2.4: Test AWS Secrets Manager integration

- [ ] Task 3: Documentation and Validation
  - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Document environment variable configuration process
  - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Create sample .env file for local development
  - [ ] Subtask 3.3: Implement environment variable validation in CI/CD pipeline
  - [ ] Subtask 3.4: Run all tests with new configuration

## Dev Notes

The previous QA improvement work identified and replaced 180 hardcoded secrets with environment variable references. This story focuses on properly implementing those environment variables and ensuring the application functions correctly with the new configuration approach.

Key considerations:
- Environment variables should be validated at application startup
- Production deployments should use AWS Secrets Manager instead of plain environment variables
- Local development should have a simple .env file approach
- All secrets should be categorized by service/component for easier management

## Testing

- Unit tests for environment variable validation service
- Integration tests for AWS Secrets Manager integration
- End-to-end tests with new configuration
- CI/CD pipeline validation
