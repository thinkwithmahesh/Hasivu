## Dev Notes

### Technical Context from Architecture

**Authentication Architecture** [Source: architecture.md#backend-services]:

- **JWT Strategy**: Access tokens (15min expiry), refresh tokens (7 days), secure httpOnly cookies for web
- **Session Management**: Redis-based session store, automatic session cleanup, concurrent session limits
- **Password Security**: bcrypt hashing with 12 rounds, minimum 8 characters with complexity requirements
- **Token Storage**: AWS Cognito for user management, Redis for session data caching

**User Model** [Source: architecture.md#data-models]:

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  role: 'PARENT' | 'SCHOOL_ADMIN' | 'VENDOR' | 'STUDENT';
  schoolId: string;
  profile: UserProfile;
  preferences: UserPreferences;
  createdAt: Date;
  lastLoginAt: Date;
  isActive: boolean;
}
```

**Authentication Middleware Pattern** [Source: architecture.md#middleware-guards]:

```typescript
export async function authenticateUser(
  event: APIGatewayProxyEvent
): Promise<User | null> {
  // JWT verification with AWS Cognito
  // Session validation with Redis
  // Automatic session extension
  // Comprehensive error handling
}

export function requireRole(requiredRole: string) {
  return (user: User | null) => {
    // Role-based access control
    // Permission validation
  };
}
```

**Database Schema** [Source: architecture.md#database-schema]:

```sql
CREATE TYPE user_role AS ENUM ('PARENT', 'SCHOOL_ADMIN', 'VENDOR', 'STUDENT');

CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    role user_role NOT NULL,
    school_id UUID REFERENCES schools(id),
    profile JSONB NOT NULL,
    preferences JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    last_login_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**API Endpoints** [Source: architecture.md#rest-api-specification]:

- **POST /auth/login**: User authentication with rate limiting
- **POST /auth/register**: User registration with email verification
- **POST /auth/refresh**: Token refresh mechanism
- **POST /auth/logout**: Session invalidation
- **POST /auth/forgot-password**: Password reset initiation
- **POST /auth/reset-password**: Password reset confirmation

**Security Requirements** [Source: architecture.md#security-implementation]:

- **Rate Limiting**: 100 requests per minute per IP, 1000 requests per hour per authenticated user
- **CORS Policy**: Restricted to known frontend origins, credentials allowed for same-origin requests
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive schema validation for all authentication endpoints
- **Audit Logging**: All authentication events logged with correlation IDs and timestamps

**Performance Targets** [Source: architecture.md#performance-optimization]:

- **Response Times**: <200ms for authentication endpoints, <100ms for token validation
- **Session Storage**: Redis caching for sub-millisecond session lookups
- **Concurrent Sessions**: Support for 1000+ concurrent authenticated users per school

### Critical Coding Standards

**Authentication Security** [Source: architecture.md#coding-standards]:

- Every protected route MUST use authentication middleware
- Never inline auth checks - use consistent middleware pattern
- All password operations MUST use bcrypt with 12 rounds
- JWT tokens MUST be validated against both signature and session store
- Session data MUST be stored in Redis with appropriate TTL

**Error Handling Pattern**:

- All authentication endpoints MUST use standard error handler
- Consistent error response format across all auth endpoints
- Security-conscious error messages (no user enumeration)
- Comprehensive logging for security audit trails

### Previous Story Context

**Dependencies from Story 1.1**:

- Monorepo structure with apps/api/ directory established
- PostgreSQL database connection and health checks operational
- Redis cache connection configured for session management
- AWS infrastructure provisioned with proper security groups
- Basic Lambda function framework with Fastify integration

### Integration Points

**AWS Cognito Integration**:

- User Pool configuration for email verification
- JWT token verification and validation
- Integration with API Gateway for request routing

**Database Integration**:

- User table operations through repository pattern
- School code validation for registration process
- Audit logging for authentication events

**Frontend Integration**:

- Mobile app authentication flow with React Native
- Web portal authentication for admin and vendor interfaces
- Automatic token refresh and session management

## Testing

### Testing Standards

- **Location**: Authentication tests in `apps/api/__tests__/functions/auth/`
- **Frameworks**: Jest for unit testing, Supertest for API integration testing
- **Coverage**: 100% coverage required for all authentication and authorization logic
- **Security Testing**: Comprehensive security test suite for authentication vulnerabilities

### Specific Test Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: All authentication service functions, middleware, and utilities
- **Integration Tests**: Complete authentication flows including registration, login, token refresh
- **Security Tests**: Brute force protection, rate limiting, role validation, session management
- **Mock Configuration**: AWS Cognito mocking for isolated testing environment
- **Performance Tests**: Authentication endpoint response time validation (<200ms)

### Test Scenarios

1. **Registration Flow**: Email verification, school code validation, role assignment
2. **Login Flow**: Credential validation, rate limiting, session creation
3. **Token Management**: JWT generation, refresh mechanism, expiration handling
4. **Authorization**: Role-based access control, permission validation
5. **Security**: Brute force protection, session hijacking prevention, input validation

### Review Date: September 3, 2025

### Reviewed By: Gemini Auditor

### 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED - ARCHITECTURAL MISMATCH**

**Status Inconsistency**: The story is marked as "COMPLETED - 100%" and claims a full serverless migration. This is **incorrect**. The current implementation is an **Express.js monolith**, not a serverless application.

### Implementation Gaps Analysis

#### ❌ **Architecture Misalignment** (CRITICAL):

- **Expected**: Serverless Lambda functions with AWS Cognito, as detailed in the user story.
- **Actual**: The application is running as an Express.js server. The file `src/index.ts` sets up an Express app and `src/routes/auth.routes.ts` defines the authentication endpoints using an Express router.
- **Impact**: This is a fundamental deviation from the documented architecture. It affects scalability, deployment, and maintenance.

#### ❌ **Duplicate Implementations**:

- The codebase contains two parallel implementations for authentication:
  1.  **Active Express.js implementation**: In `src/routes/auth.routes.ts`.
  2.  **Inactive Lambda functions**: In `src/functions/auth/`.
- **Impact**: This creates confusion and makes the codebase difficult to maintain. It's unclear which implementation is the source of truth.

### Final Status

**❌ NOT COMPLETE - REQUIRES URGENT ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW**

### Recommendations

#### **Immediate Actions**:

1.  **Architectural Decision**: The development team must decide whether to proceed with the Express.js implementation or to migrate to the serverless architecture as documented.
2.  **Remove Duplicate Code**: Once a decision is made, the unused implementation must be removed from the codebase.
3.  **Update Documentation**: All documentation, including this user story, must be updated to reflect the chosen architecture. The "COMPLETED" status must be removed.
