# Epic 5 Story 5.2: Subscription Billing Management Implementation

## Overview
Story 5.2 implements a comprehensive subscription billing management system with automated recurring billing, dunning management, flexible subscription plans, and detailed analytics. This builds on the advanced payment features from Story 5.1.

## Architecture

### Lambda Functions
Five serverless functions handle different aspects of subscription billing:

1. **subscription-management.ts** - Core subscription CRUD operations
2. **billing-automation.ts** - Automated recurring billing processing
3. **subscription-plans.ts** - Subscription plan management
4. **dunning-management.ts** - Failed payment handling and retry logic
5. **subscription-analytics.ts** - Comprehensive subscription metrics and reporting

### Database Models Used
- `Subscription` - Core subscription entity
- `SubscriptionPlan` - Plan definitions and pricing
- `BillingCycle` - Individual billing periods
- `PaymentMethod` - Stored payment methods
- `Payment` - Payment transactions
- `PaymentRetry` - Retry attempt tracking

## Lambda Function Details
