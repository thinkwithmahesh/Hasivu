### ⚠️ Limited Support Browsers

**Safari (Desktop & Mobile)**

- Status: ⚠️ Limited Compatibility
- Issue: Widespread component rendering problems

**Technical Investigation Summary:**

- Chrome/Firefox: All tests pass (3-8s execution time)
- Safari: Systematic failures with element not found errors
- Pattern: Safari cannot locate `[data-testid="*"]` elements across the application
- Likely causes:
  1. Next.js Server-Side Rendering incompatibilities with Safari
  2. CSS-in-JS styling not loading properly in Safari
  3. JavaScript module loading timing issues
  4. React hydration problems specific to Safari

## Production Readiness Assessment

### Market Share Analysis

- Chrome: ~65% market share in education sector
- Firefox: ~15% market share
