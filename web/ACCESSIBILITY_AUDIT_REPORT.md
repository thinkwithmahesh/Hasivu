# HASIVU Platform - Comprehensive Accessibility Audit & Research Report

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive accessibility audit evaluates the HASIVU school platform against WCAG 2.1 AA standards and provides detailed recommendations for creating an inclusive educational technology platform that serves all members of the school community.

## Current Platform Analysis

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 13+ with React 18

- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit with persistence
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with validation
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js

### Existing Accessibility Foundation

#### ✅ Strengths Identified

1. **Radix UI Foundation**: Components built on Radix UI provide solid accessibility primitives
2. **Focus Management**: Basic focus-visible styles implemented
3. **Mobile Optimizations**: Touch targets sized appropriately (44px minimum)
4. **Semantic HTML**: Form components use proper label associations
5. **Color System**: Comprehensive color palette with semantic naming
6. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with proper breakpoints

#### ❌ Critical Gaps Identified

1. **ARIA Implementation**: Missing comprehensive ARIA patterns
2. **Screen Reader Support**: Limited screen reader optimizations
3. **Keyboard Navigation**: Inconsistent keyboard interaction patterns
4. **Color Contrast**: Unverified contrast ratios across all color combinations
5. **Error Handling**: Basic error messaging without accessibility considerations
6. **Skip Navigation**: No skip links for screen reader users
7. **High Contrast Support**: Limited high contrast mode implementation
8. **Language Support**: Basic i18n setup but missing accessibility language features
