- **Alternative Text**: Comprehensive image and chart descriptions

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
// Consistent data types across components
interface Student {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  class: string;
  walletBalance: number;
  nutritionScore: number;
  // ... additional properties
}
```

### Chart Integration
```typescript
// Recharts integration for data visualization
import { 
  BarChart, LineChart, PieChart, AreaChart,
  ResponsiveContainer, CartesianGrid, Tooltip
} from 'recharts';
```

### Real-time Updates
```typescript
// Auto-refresh functionality
useEffect(() => {
  if (autoRefresh) {
    const refreshTimer = setInterval(() => {
      // Fetch fresh data from API
    }, 30000);
    return () => clearInterval(refreshTimer);
  }
}, [autoRefresh]);
```

## 📊 Data Flow

### Mock Data Structure
All dashboards use consistent mock data from `/src/lib/demo-data.ts`:

```typescript
export const demoData = {
  school: demoSchool,
  students: demoStudents,
  parents: demoParents,
  admins: demoAdmins,
  kitchenStaff: demoKitchenStaff,
  // ... additional data sets
};
```

### API Integration Points
The components are designed to easily integrate with real APIs:

```typescript
// Example API integration pattern
const fetchStudentData = async (studentId: string) => {
  // Replace mock data with actual API calls
  return await api.get(`/students/${studentId}`);
};
```

## 🚀 Deployment & Usage

### Environment Setup
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

### Component Usage
```typescript
import { 
  EnhancedStudentDashboard,
  EnhancedParentDashboard,
  EnhancedAdminDashboard,
  EnhancedKitchenDashboard 
} from '@/components/dashboard';

// Use in your application
<EnhancedStudentDashboard student={studentData} />
```
