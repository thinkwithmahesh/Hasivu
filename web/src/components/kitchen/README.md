# Kitchen Management System

## Overview

The Kitchen Management System is a comprehensive solution for managing all aspects of kitchen operations in the HASIVU platform. It provides real-time order tracking, inventory management, staff coordination, and workflow optimization for school meal services.

## Components

### 1. Kitchen Management Dashboard (`KitchenManagementDashboard.tsx`)

The main dashboard providing an overview of all kitchen operations.

#### Features:
- **Real-time Metrics**: Orders in progress, average preparation time, completion rates
- **Order Management**: Tabbed interface for orders, staff, inventory, and analytics
- **Staff Monitoring**: Live staff status, efficiency tracking, task assignments
- **Inventory Alerts**: Low stock notifications and critical item monitoring

#### Key Metrics Displayed:
- Orders in Progress: 15
- Average Preparation Time: 18.5 minutes
- Completion Rate: 94.2%
- Active Staff: 8

### 2. Order Workflow Board (`OrderWorkflowBoard.tsx`)

A Kanban-style drag-and-drop interface for managing order progression through kitchen stages.

#### Features:
- **Drag & Drop Interface**: Move orders between pending, preparing, ready, and completed
- **Real-time Updates**: Auto-refresh with progress tracking
- **Enhanced Order Cards**: Priority indicators, allergen alerts, staff assignments
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bars for orders in preparation

#### Workflow Stages:
1. **Pending**: Orders waiting to be prepared
2. **Preparing**: Orders currently being cooked
3. **Ready**: Orders ready for pickup
4. **Completed**: Successfully delivered orders

#### Order Card Information:
- Order number and student details
- Priority level (high, medium, low)
- Item breakdown with preparation times
- Allergen warnings
- Special instructions
- Assigned staff member
- Estimated completion time
- Customer ratings (for completed orders)

### 3. Inventory Management (`InventoryManagement.tsx`)

Comprehensive inventory tracking and supplier management system.

#### Features:
- **Stock Level Monitoring**: Real-time stock levels with min/max thresholds
- **Automated Alerts**: Low stock, out of stock, and expiry warnings
- **Supplier Management**: Rating, reliability, and delivery tracking
- **Purchase Order Management**: Create, track, and manage orders
- **Usage Analytics**: Consumption rates and forecasting

#### Inventory Item Details:
- Current stock vs. min/max levels
- Usage rate and days until empty
- Supplier information and ratings
- Expiry date tracking
- Storage location
- Cost per unit and total value

#### Supplier Metrics:
- Rating (out of 5 stars)
- Reliability percentage
- Average delivery time
- Total orders completed

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
All components use React hooks for local state management:
- `useState` for component state
- `useEffect` for real-time updates and cleanup

### Animation System
Utilizes Framer Motion for:
- Smooth drag-and-drop transitions
- Card animations and hover effects
- Loading states and progress indicators

### TypeScript Interfaces

```typescript
// Core order interface
interface Order {
  id: string;
  orderNumber: string;
  studentName: string;
  items: OrderItem[];
  status: 'pending' | 'preparing' | 'ready' | 'completed';
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  estimatedTime: number;
  assignedStaff?: string;
  location: string;
  totalAmount: number;
}

// Inventory item interface
interface InventoryItem {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  category: string;
  currentStock: number;
  minStock: number;
  maxStock: number;
  unit: string;
  costPerUnit: number;
  supplier: Supplier;
  status: 'in_stock' | 'low_stock' | 'out_of_stock';
  usageRate: number;
  daysUntilEmpty: number;
}

// Kitchen staff interface
interface KitchenStaff {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  role: 'chef' | 'assistant' | 'prep' | 'manager';
  status: 'active' | 'break' | 'offline';
  efficiency: number;
  hoursWorked: number;
  tasksCompleted: number;
}
```

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-optimized layouts
- Flexible grid systems
- Touch-friendly drag and drop
- Responsive typography and spacing
