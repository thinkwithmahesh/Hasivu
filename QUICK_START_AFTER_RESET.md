## 🚀 Immediate Actions (Copy-Paste Ready)

### Step 1: Launch All 4 Agents Simultaneously

**Agent 1: Order Management Restoration**

```
/task Restore 5 order management Lambda functions from .bak files in src/functions/orders/. Update each to match current Prisma Order model schema (userId, studentId, schoolId, orderNumber, status, paymentStatus). Fix TypeScript errors. Create unit tests for each function. Write active versions without .bak extension. Ensure 0 TypeScript errors. Target: 2-3 hours.
```

**Agent 2: Payment System Implementation**

```
/task Implement complete payment processing system from scratch. Create src/functions/shared/razorpay.service.ts with Razorpay SDK integration. Implement 9 payment functions: create-payment-order, verify-payment, webhook-handler, process-refund, get-payment-status, retry-payment, subscription-payment, invoice-generation, payment-analytics. Use PaymentOrder, PaymentTransaction, PaymentRefund models from Prisma schema. Implement webhook signature verification. Create unit tests. Target: 3-4 hours.
```

**Agent 3: RFID Extended Features**

```
/task Restore 6 RFID extended functions from .bak files in src/functions/rfid/: bulk-import-cards, get-card, manage-readers, mobile-card-management, mobile-tracking, photo-verification. Update to match current RFIDCard, RFIDReader, DeliveryVerification models. Fix field names: lastPing→lastHeartbeat, rfidCard→card, rfidReader→reader, rfidCardId→cardId. Create unit tests. Target: 2 hours.
```

**Agent 4: Validation & Testing**

```
/task Continuously validate all code changes. Run: npx prisma validate, npx tsc --noEmit (backend), cd web && npm run type-check (frontend), npm test -- --coverage. Check TypeScript errors, ESLint issues, test coverage >80%, integration tests. Provide interim reports every 30 minutes. Generate final comprehensive validation report.
```

## 🎯 Critical Gaps Identified

### 🚨 P0 - CRITICAL (Blocks Business Operations)

1. **Order Management - 5 Functions Missing**
   - Files exist as `.bak` backups
   - Must restore and update to schema
   - **Impact**: Cannot create or manage orders
   - **Blocker**: Core business functionality

2. **Payment Processing - 9+ Functions Missing**
   - No functions exist (empty directory)
   - Must implement from scratch
   - Razorpay SDK integration needed
   - **Impact**: Cannot process any payments
   - **Blocker**: Revenue generation

### ⚠️ P1 - HIGH (Limits Operations)

3. **RFID Extended Features - 6 Functions Missing**
   - Core RFID works (3 functions operational)
   - Extended features as `.bak` backups
   - **Impact**: Limited admin tools, no bulk import
   - **Enhancement**: Operations and parent experience

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Agent Hits Session Limit Again

1. Review agent output for completed work
2. Note which files were created/modified
3. Continue with remaining tasks manually or wait for next session

### If TypeScript Errors Appear

1. Check agent output for specific errors
2. Most likely: Schema field name mismatches
3. Common fixes: userId vs user_id, camelCase vs snake_case
4. Refer to schema in EPIC_VERIFICATION_MATRIX.md

### If Tests Fail

1. Check mock setup (Prisma client mocking)
2. Verify imports from @prisma/client
3. Check field names match schema
4. Review test files in tests/unit/functions/

### If Payment Integration Issues

1. Verify Razorpay test credentials
2. Check webhook signature verification
3. Ensure environment variables set
4. Review Razorpay SDK documentation

## 💡 Key Insights from Analysis

### What's Working Well

- ✅ Authentication system is production-ready
- ✅ User management is complete
- ✅ Mobile notifications working perfectly
- ✅ Core RFID functionality operational
- ✅ Database schema comprehensive and well-designed

### Critical Blockers Identified

- 🚨 Order management completely non-functional
- 🚨 Payment processing doesn't exist
- ⚠️ RFID extended features limited

### Architecture Observations

- Hybrid pattern: Some features in Lambda, some in Next.js API routes
- Analytics/Nutrition in Next.js (works but inconsistent)
- Order/Payment should be Lambda but missing
- Decision needed: Standardize on Lambda OR accept hybrid

---

## 🚀 After Critical Path Complete

### Next Steps (Non-Blocking)

1. **Architecture Decision**: Analytics/Nutrition migration
2. **Menu Management**: Create Lambda functions OR keep in Next.js
3. **Performance Optimization**: Add caching layer
4. **Enhanced Features**: Advanced analytics, AI recommendations

### Monitoring & Operations

1. Set up CloudWatch dashboards
2. Configure payment alerts
3. Monitor RFID reader health
4. Track order completion rates
5. Monitor payment success rates
