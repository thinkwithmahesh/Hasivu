# Archon Integration & Workflow

**CRITICAL: This project uses Archon for knowledge management, task tracking, and project organization.**

## Core Archon Workflow Principles

### The Golden Rule: Task-Driven Development with Archon

**MANDATORY: Always complete the full Archon task cycle before any coding:**

1. **Check Current Task** → Review task details and requirements
2. **Research for Task** → Search relevant documentation and examples
3. **Implement the Task** → Write code based on research
4. **Update Task Status** → Move task from "todo" → "doing" → "review"
5. **Get Next Task** → Check for next priority task
6. **Repeat Cycle**

**Task Management Rules:**
- Update all actions to Archon
- Move tasks from "todo" → "doing" → "review" (not directly to complete)
- Maintain task descriptions and add implementation notes
- DO NOT MAKE ASSUMPTIONS - check project documentation for questions
