# Reality Check Report

**Audit Date:** September 3, 2025
**Auditor:** Gemini

## 1. Executive Summary

This audit reveals a critical disconnect between the project's documentation and its implementation. The codebase is currently an **Express.js monolith**, while the user stories and architectural documents all specify a **serverless architecture using AWS Lambda**. This fundamental architectural mismatch is the most serious issue facing the project.

Furthermore, the documentation is dangerously misleading. User stories are marked as "Done" or "Completed", but the features they describe are either partially implemented or missing entirely. This indicates a broken development and QA process.

The project is in a precarious state. Urgent intervention is required to align the architecture, implementation, and documentation before any further development can proceed.

## 2. Key Findings

### 2.1. Architectural Mismatch (Critical)

*   **Finding:** The entire application is built as an Express.js monolith, loading all routes and services at startup.
*   **Documentation:** All user stories and architectural documents reviewed specify a serverless architecture using AWS Lambda and Cognito.
*   **Impact:** This discrepancy affects scalability, cost, deployment, and maintenance. It also means that any work done on the current codebase may be thrown away if a migration to serverless is attempted.

### 2.2. Inaccurate Documentation (Critical)

*   **Finding:** User stories for major features (Authentication, RFID, Payments, Notifications) are marked as "Done" or "Completed".
*   **Reality:** My audit found that none of these features are fully implemented. Some are grossly incomplete, and all are built on the wrong architecture.
*   **Impact:** This gives a false sense of progress and makes it impossible to plan future work accurately. It also points to a significant failure in the project's QA and governance processes.

### 2.3. Incomplete and Inconsistent Implementation

*   **Authentication (`auth`):**
    *   **Status:** Does Not Satisfy User Story.
    *   **Issues:** Dual implementation (active Express.js routes and inactive Lambda functions). Lacks Cognito integration as required.
*   **RFID (`rfid`):**
    *   **Status:** Does Not Satisfy User Story.
    *   **Issues:** Grossly incomplete. Only one endpoint exists, and it is a non-functional placeholder.
*   **Payments (`payment`):**
    *   **Status:** Partially Satisfies User Story.
    *   **Issues:** Implements some Razorpay functionality but is missing Stripe integration, analytics, and multi-currency support.
*   **Notifications (`notification`):**
    *   **Status:** Partially Satisfies User Story.
    *   **Issues:** Implements basic notification sending but is missing preference management, a template engine, and an emergency system. Many endpoints are incomplete (`// TODO:`).
*   **Health Check (`health`):**
    *   **Status:** Partially Satisfies.
    *   **Issues:** Two different implementations exist. The simpler, less comprehensive one is being used.

## 3. Recommendations

### 3.1. Immediate Actions (Urgent)

1.  **Halt All New Feature Development:** No new features should be developed until the architectural issues are resolved.
2.  **Architectural Summit:** A meeting must be held immediately with all stakeholders (development, product, management) to make a final decision on the project's architecture:
    *   **Option A: Embrace the Monolith:** Formally adopt the Express.js architecture. All documentation must be updated to reflect this. The serverless-specific code (e.g., the `src/functions` directory) should be removed.
    *   **Option B: Commit to Serverless:** Begin a formal, planned migration to the serverless architecture as documented. The existing Express.js code will need to be refactored into Lambda functions.
3.  **Update All Documentation:** Regardless of the architectural decision, all user stories and other documentation must be updated to reflect the *actual* state of the implementation. The "Done" statuses must be removed, and the QA sections I have added should be reviewed and integrated.

### 3.2. Short-Term Actions

1.  **Code Cleanup:** Remove all duplicate and unused code, such as the redundant health check implementation.
2.  **Roadmap Revision:** Once an architectural decision has been made and the documentation has been corrected, the project roadmap needs to be completely revised to reflect the true amount of work remaining.

### 3.3. Long-Term Actions

1.  **Process Improvement:** The project's development and QA processes need to be fundamentally reformed. A system must be put in place to ensure that documentation is accurate and that features are not marked as "Done" until they are fully implemented, tested, and verified against the documented requirements.
2.  **Automated Auditing:** Consider implementing automated checks to ensure that the codebase adheres to the chosen architectural patterns.

## 4. Conclusion

Project Hasivu is at a critical juncture. The current disconnect between documentation and reality is unsustainable. The recommendations in this report should be acted upon immediately to bring the project back on track.
