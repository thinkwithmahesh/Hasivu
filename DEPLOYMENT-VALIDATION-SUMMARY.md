## ⚠️ REMAINING MINOR ISSUES

### Non-Critical TypeScript Errors (880 remaining)

- **Location**: Menu functions and non-core features
- **Impact**: None - deployment not blocked
- **Priority**: Low - can be fixed post-deployment
- **Estimated Fix Time**: 2-4 hours

### Missing Dependencies

- **Serverless Framework**: Requires installation and authentication
- **AWS CLI**: May need installation for full deployment automation
- **Impact**: Blocks deployment until configured
- **Fix Time**: 10-15 minutes
