# Hasivu Platform: World-Class Product Plan

## Objective

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to address all outstanding issues in the Hasivu platform and elevate it to a world-class product. The plan is divided into five phases, each with specific, actionable tasks.

## Identified Gaps from Code Audit

Based on a comprehensive code audit, the following gaps have been identified between the documented stories and the actual implementation. These gaps must be addressed to ensure the platform is feature-complete and production-ready.

### Critical Gaps

- **Lack of Automated Tests:** There is no test suite for the application. This is the most critical issue and must be addressed with the highest priority.
- **Manual Deployment Process:** The deployment process is not automated, which is a significant risk for production deployments.

### Feature Gaps

- **Menu Management API:** While the services for menu management exist (`dailyMenu.service.ts`, `menuItem.service.ts`, `menuPlan.service.ts`), there are no API routes to expose this functionality. The following endpoints are missing:
  - `GET /api/v1/menus`
  - `GET /api/v1/menus/:id`
  - `POST /api/v1/menus`
  - `PUT /api/v1/menus/:id`
  - `DELETE /api/v1/menus/:id`
  - `GET /api/v1/menu-items`
  - `GET /api/v1/menu-items/:id`
  - `POST /api/v1/menu-items`
  - `PUT /api/v1/menu-items/:id`
  - `DELETE /api/v1/menu-items/:id`
- **Order Management API:** The `order.service.ts` exists, but the API for managing orders is completely missing. The following endpoints are missing:
  - `GET /api/v1/orders`
  - `GET /api/v1/orders/:id`
  - `POST /api/v1/orders`
  - `PUT /api/v1/orders/:id`
  - `DELETE /api/v1/orders/:id`
- **RFID API:** The RFID API is incomplete. The following endpoints are missing:
  - `POST /api/v1/rfid/verify`
  - `PUT /api/v1/rfid/readers/:id/status`
  - `GET /api/v1/rfid/verifications`
  - `POST /api/v1/rfid/cards/:id/deactivate`
  - `POST /api/v1/rfid/bulk-register`
  - `GET /api/v1/rfid/analytics`
- **Notification API:** The Notification API is incomplete. The following endpoints are missing:
  - `POST /api/v1/notifications/order-confirmation`
  - `POST /api/v1/notifications/order-status-update`
  - `POST /api/v1/notifications/:id/read`
  - `GET /api/v1/notifications`
  - `PUT /api/v1/notifications/preferences`
  - `GET /api/v1/notifications/analytics`
- **Invoice Management:** There is no explicit support for generating or managing invoices.
- **Enterprise Multi-School Management Platform:** This feature is completely missing.
- **Advanced Analytics & Business Intelligence Hub:** While there is a basic analytics service, a dedicated BI hub is not implemented.
